# Sound Cave Wiki — Log

## [2026-04-28] two-pillar restructure
- Top-nav reduced from 6 tabs to 3: Home, The Cave, Firepit
- The Cave now contains sub-nav for Dashboard / Foraging / Clan / Footprints
- Firepit remains standalone (will expand into creation + scheduling pillar)
- See `decisions/2026-04-28-two-pillar-restructure.md`
- Files touched: `index.html`, `js/app.js`, `css/style.css`

## [2026-04-28] init | wiki scaffolded
- Adopted wiki-first workflow across workspace
- Seeded `spec/overview.md` from existing memory (`project_soundcave_pivot.md`, `project_soundcave_next.md`) — flagged DRAFT
- Wrote `features/firepit_forge.md` from memory
- Wrote `decisions/0001_pivot_to_content_creation.md` retroactively
- Open: personas, Footprints, image gen decision, full feature catalogue

## [2026-04-28] spec lock + feature catalogue
- Doug answered open spec questions: SoundCloud scouting + bulk AI content + multi-platform distribution/scheduling; paid only; hosted SaaS target; hosted web; no alternatives considered for the pivot
- `spec/overview.md` updated and approved (DRAFT removed)
- `decisions/0001` updated with paid-only and "no alternatives — open to pivot" stance
- Added `decisions/0002_architecture.md` (vanilla FE, Flask BE, multi-provider AI, SaaS migration consequences)
- Added feature pages: The Cave, Foraging, Clan, Footprints, Firepit Stash, Firepit Trail Map
- Added persona stubs: Artist, Label, Promoter
- Updated `index.md` with full catalogue
